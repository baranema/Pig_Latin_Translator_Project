# Pig Latin Translator Project

Project by Emilija B. originally created in **April 2022**. The project was uploaded later because it was previously stored in a different repository.

This is a Python program that translates English sentences into Pig Latin.

Pig Latin is a language game that is often used by children to speak in code. It is a simple way to alter English words so that they are difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with the rules of the game. The Pig Latin language consists of a few simple rules for converting English words into Pig Latin:

* If a word begins with a consonant sound, move the consonant to the end of the word and add "ay."
* If a word begins with a vowel sound, add "way" to the end of the word.

This program takes an English sentence as input and translates it into Pig Latin.
